P5P-Weekly
==========

This repository is an archive of my weekly Perl 5 Porters email traffic summaries. Originally I
wrote these in HTML and posted them directly on my blog, but now I create a Markdown formatted 
summary and then convert that into HTML for distribution on my blog and mirrors on blogs.perl.org.

The archive is organized by year/month/first-day-of-the-summary.md

So a summary that covers August 27-September 2, 2012 would be found in

2012/08/27.md

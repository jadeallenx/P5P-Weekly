**perldoc perlre does not appear to mention /r**

Jacinta Richardson sent a message that the non-destructive /r flag
for Perl's RE engine does not appear in the perlre perldoc corpus.
There were some suggestions to briefly document the flags in perlre
and point to the "definitive" documentation.

**Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammars**

Dave Mitchell followed up with some feature enhancements which may
make it into Perl 5.20 for building parsers on top of Perl written
in Perl (that aren't evil source filters.) Damian Conway approves.

**"\c\" is a syntax error**

Perl has a shorthand for "Control+CHAR" which is a string expressed
as "\\cX" where X is some character. The problem is that \\ escapes
the next character include a quote, so a literal Control+\\ can't be easily
expressed using this syntax.

Some possible solutions are proposed in the thread.

**Apologies and good news**

Dennis Kaarsemaker runs a lot of the Perl infrastructure including the
git repository and the Jenkins build system(s).  The physical machines
these services live on have been refreshed by Booking.com and Dennis
reports on several updates and improvements.

**postfix dereference syntax**

RJBS has signalled that the proposed scalar-reference dereference syntax 
(e.g., `my @data = $hashref->{'list_of_things'}->@*` vs. 
`my @data = @{ $hashref->{'list_of_things'} }`) for arrays and hashes be
accepted into the 5.20 release.

**Cuckoo packages aren't listed in Module::Corelist**

Neil Bowers wants to add "cuckoo" packages (these are packages
that are defined as multiple packages in one physical .pm file)
to the Module::Corelist data.

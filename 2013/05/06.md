Perl 5 Porters Weekly: May 6-12, 2013
=====================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.  The big news this week is the release of 
perl-5.18.0-RC1 *and* RC2.

Topics this week include:

* perl-5.18.0-RC2 is now available
* Proposal: initial type annotation in SV
* What does PERL\_HASH\_SEED do?
* Designing an API
* Should we make hashes return keys in FIFO order?
* Release timing drift

**perl-5.18.0-RC2 is now available**

Fire up perlbrew: 5.18.0-RC2 is here. Time to test all your modules 
against this release candidate!  The perldelta also makes great 
reading - all the stuff that's new and different.  Some highlights
include the hash ordering changes, experimental lexical subroutines,
Unicode 6.2 support, `given` aliasing global $\_ and a metric
ton of bug fixes in the `/(?{})/` and `/(??{})/` regex constructions.

**Proposal: initial type annotation in SV**

SÃ©bastien Aperghis-Tramoni wants to record the initial type of an SV to
help perl data serializers (Storable, Sereal, JSON::XS, etc) properly
encode Perl data structures.

**What does PERL\_HASH\_SEED do?**

Just in time for perl-5.18 Yves Orton committed patches to make the 
environment variable PERL\_HASH\_SEED (and some new helpers) change
the behaviors of hash storage and traversal.

**Designing an API**

Responding to Nicholas Clark's email pointing out that XS doesn't have 
a 'real' API, Yves Orton asks, should there be one?

**Should we make hashes return keys in FIFO order?**

Not quite done with hashing, Yves Orton asks if perl in 5.20 should
return keys in FIFO order (i.e., return keys in the order they were
inserted.) Some love it, some hate it; standard P5P reaction. :)

**Release timing drift**

David Golden points out that perl releases seem to be drifting
further back in the year than earlier yearly releases.  He proposes
moving freezes forward a month so blockers can be resolved with
less urgency.

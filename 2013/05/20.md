**RFC: Deprecating Module::Build**

David Golden proposed removing Module::Build from the core distribution. 

He offers the following rationale:

> * Module::Build has been in life-support maintainance for a couple
> years now (thank you leont for taking up that awful task)
>
> * CPAN clients have supported configure\_requires to bootstrap a build
> tool since Perl 5.10.1 almost a decade ago
>
> * CPAN.pm has support for auto-detecting an undeclared dependency on
> Module::Build and installing it when needed

**RFC: Removing CGI.pm from the core distribution**

RJBS proposed removing CGI.pm from the Perl core distribution. He writes:

> I think it's time to seriously consider removing CGI.pm from the core
> distribution.  It is no longer what I'd point *anyone* at for writing *any*
> sort of web code.  It is in the core, as far as I know, because once it was the
> state of the art, and a major reason for many people to use the language.  I
> don't think either is true now.  Finally, if you need CGI, it's easy to install
> after installing perl, just like everything else we've dropped from the core
> distribution.

**I made t/podcheck.t less sensitive and fixed various pod issues**

David Golden, following up on some Jenkins failures due to POD issues
pushed a number of commits to make the test less sensitive and fix
some of the other outstanding issues.

Some of the other porters didn't appreciate the changes or the manner
in which they were pushed.

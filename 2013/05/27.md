Perl 5 Porters Weekly: May 27-June 2, 2013
==========================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list. I'll be at YAPC all week, so be sure to say
"Hi!" if you see me or [come to my talk][8].

Topics this week include:

* CGI.pm and Module::Build to leave core
* CGI.pm is dead, long live CGI.pm
* Building foundations...
* Storable refactoring

**CGI.pm and Module::Build to leave core**

Ricardo Signes (RJBS) announced that CGI.pm and Module::Build will be 
leaving perl's core.

[Read the terse announcement][1]

**CGI.pm is dead, long live CGI.pm**

Aristotle Pagaltzis wrote a reply explaining why he thinks a system like
Plack is superior to CGI.pm and why CGI.pm ought not to be used by
Perl newbies. 

This was a very active thread this week.

**Building foundations...**

Leon Timmermans wrote a "belated reaction" to [A Funny Thing Happened on the
Way to the P5-Mop][3].  He wrote:

Very interesting thread, especially some of the historical context from
former pumpking Chip Salzenberg.

**Storable refactoring**

In response to a [gnarly bug reported by Reini Urban][5], Salvador Fandino
decloaked on P5P to offer up a [signficantly refactored Storable][6] module.

I haven't examined it in depth, but it certainly fixes a lot of the 
ugly parts of the current code.

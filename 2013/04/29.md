Perl 5 Porters Weekly: April 29, 2013-May 5, 2013
=================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list. 

Topics this week include:

* Sequence (?#...) not recognized in regex
* How on earth did we manage to break pack() so badly?
* DAVEM TPF Grant April Report
* Problems with Carp::longmess() in 5.17.10 and before
* What does PERL\_HASH\_SEED do?

**Sequence (?#...) not recognized in regex**

Karl Williamson reports on a problem in Perl's regex engine which he's made a patch for. This thread
goes over the specifics and asks RJBS how the patch ought to be applied to blead for 5.18.

[April thread][1]

[May thread][2]

**How on earth did we manage to break pack() so badly**

Yves Orton writes, um, a strong critique of the behavior of pack() since 5.10. He feels it's
annoying and wrong. Dave Mitchell thinks it might need some tweaks but is basically proper
behavior.

**DAVEM TPF Grant April 2013 Report**

Dave Mitchell gives his monthly summary of work done on perl as part of his TPF grant. These
are always interesting reads if you like to track the history of perl bug detection and squashing.

**Problems with Carp::longmess() in 5.17.10 and before**

Watch live code archealogy as P5P digs deep into some messy internals of Carp.

[April thread][5]

[May thread][6]

**What does PERL\_HASH\_SEED do?**

Steve Hay asks about the variance between the documented behavior of this environment
variable and the observed behavior in blead.

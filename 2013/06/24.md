Perl 5 Porters Weekly: June 24-30, 2013
=======================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.

Topics this week include:

* Idly musing about vtables for hashes
* Raison d'être of op\_ppaddr
* Building real CPAN dists in core perl
* postfix dereference syntax
* experimental: linux abstract domain sockets
* the mystery of undef upstreams
* Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammars
* What does "deprecated" mean?
* RFC: Any objections to preserving spaces in prototypes
* Removing old utilities
* podcheck and long lines

**Idly musing about vtables for hashes**

Steffen Mueller muses about a pluggable implementation for hashing with 
the potential benefit of having multiple hash-like structure implementations
that could be swapped on a per-instance basis - this could tighten up
memory utilization of blessed hashes used as objects.

**Raison d'être of op_ppaddr**

Steffen Mueller riddles P5P about the ppaddr opcode. Paul Johnson explains
that he uses some of it for evil purposes in Devel::Cover (and there are
some other contributors to this answer.)

**Building real CPAN dists in core perl**

LeoNerd asks about making dual-lifed modules build more like a traditional
"from-CPAN". David Golden replies that he's in favor of this generally 
speaking.

**postfix dereference syntax**

RJBS posts some of the ugly inconsistency in perl's dereference syntax. He
wonders how it could be improved but no one seemed to respond.

**experimental: linux abstract domain sockets**

Rik posted another "experimental" part of perl from 5.12 perldelta. He's 
leaning toward removing its experimental designation. There was no 
discussion.

**the mystery of undef upstreams**

The fearless pumpking Ricardo Signes posted a message that he'd like to
clean up the Porting/Maintainers.pl file in two ways:

1. determine the upstream for undecided dists
2. drop the "person on the spot" listing for things where it's not useful

Discussion ensued.

**Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammars**

Perl 5.18 broke the Regexp::Grammars module and there doesn't seem to be
an easy way to make it work. This thread is discussing what can be done
to make it work again in the future. Also it appears that there was a bug
that surfaced in the 5.18 regex engine which Dave Mitchell isolated and
Karl Williamson was looking for a suggestion on what ought to be done
to fix it.

**What does "deprecated" mean?**

There's been a thread running since June 17 about whether the use of the
bare literal `<<` to mean `<<""` should be marked as deprecated (with
a warning) or should be a hard error or nothing should be done (business
as usual.) 

This week the thread turned philosophical with some of the 
people in the thread trying to hash out what the word "deprecated"
means for an end-user and what it means in terms of future work for
P5P.

**RFC: Any objections to preserving spaces in prototypes**

Peter Martini asks if anyone objects to preserving whitespace
in prototypes. The current implementation strips whitespace.

[Read the thread][9]

**Removing old utilities**

Leon Timmermans proposes to remove several old utilities from the 
core distribution.  In particular he suggestions removing these:

* s2p
* a2p
* find2perl
* h2xs
* c2ph
* h2ph
* enc2xs
* libnetcfg
* pl2pm

Is anyone still using these, and if so, should they be in
the core distribution?

[Read the thread][10]

**podcheck and long lines**

RJBS reported the status of his branch with some work on the 
podcheck/long lines controversy of a few weeks ago.  He writes that
he stalled on this but Brian Gottreu picked up the work and submitted
[a patch which was applied][11].

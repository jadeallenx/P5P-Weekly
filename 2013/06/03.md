Perl 5 Porters Weekly: June 3-9, 2013
=====================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.

Topics this week include:

* DAVEM TPF Grant May 2013 report
* dtrace sub-entry probe against lexical sub segfaults
* COW and THINKFIRST and related safety

**DAVEM TPF Grant May 2013 report**

Dave Mitchell posted his monthly summary of the work he's done on the 
Perl core.

> This month was mostly spent on removing global state from the regex
> engine, making re-entrantcy less error-prone. The extract from the merge
> commit description below gives you all the details you could ever want.
>
> Apart from that I spent a few hours re-enabling Copy-on-Write by default
> post the 5.18.0 release, plus a few other bits and pieces.
>
> It turns out that I have finally used up all the hours on my grant plus
> extensions. I really must get round to applying for a new grant sometime
> soon!

**dtrace sub-entry probe against lexical sub segfaults**

During my [talk about DTrace][2] at YAPC::NA this past week, Ricardo Signes
found and filed a bug against the lexical subroutine changes in blead with
respect to the Perl sub-entry DTrace probe.

There's a patch for the segfault, but the unit test appears broken.

**COW and THINKFIRST and related safety**

RJBS wanted to point out some messages from Dave Mitchell about the safe way
to deal with strings in the C/XS layer of Perl which became tricksier with
the introduction of Copy-on-Write.

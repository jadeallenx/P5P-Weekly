**Regexp error messages are not UTF8-clean**

James Keenan asked for an update on a year-old RT ticket about errors
not being UTF8 clean which kicked off an interesting discussion about
how to support UTF8 in perl error strings.

**Re: perl needs safer implicit close**

David Golden wrote an email to P5P with what seems to be a good suggestion
about how to provide a better mechanism to deal with failed implicit close 
operations. It has to do with adding a DESTROY block to IO::Handle.

**Add an API to attach a signature to a CV**

In this message Peter Martini provided a "big picture" plan for his
sub-signatures work. He writes:

> Bigger picture is a few different pieces:
> 
> Piece 1: Simplest piece, this, which the existing CPAN modules can take 
> advantage of easily, attach a string for Deparse or any other method 
> listing to display the signature.
> 
> Piece 2: A prototype attribute, so the core will support a standard 
> alternate to supply a prototype inline.  I'm cleaning up that one now 
> and expect to create a ticket with my reasoning, if not code, tonight.
> 
> Piece 3: A parser hook so a module can parse a signature itself (as XS 
> or a raw function pointer), and configure the CV / PAD appropriately.  
> Lexically scoped.
>
> Piece 4: A hook on the CV which can be executed in entersub at the point 
> where defgv would be populated, so any parameter validation / 
> initialization can be done before the sub is actually entered.

**Article on debugging memory problems**

Perl 5 Porters Weekly: June 10-16, 2013
=======================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.

Topics this week include:

* [PATCH] use dots - allow '.' instead of '->' everywhere and concat with '~'
* NWCLARK TPF grant April report
* I made t/podcheck.t less sensitive and fixed various pod issues
* perl needs safer implicit close
* An observation: Short- vs. long-term benefits
* [PATCH] Add an API to attach a signature string to a CV
* Perl experiments

**[PATCH] use dots - allow '.' instead of '->' everywhere and concat with '~'**

During his lightning talk on the last day at YAPC, Chip Salzenburg mentioned he'd
just finished a patch to use dots instead of the arrow for method dispatch and 
hash traversal.  The [patch][1] was formally submitted the P5P just after I had
finished posting my summary.  Throughout the week a lively and opinionated
discussion about the patch occurred until Ricardo made the call on Friday night
about whether to ship this or not.  [He wrote][2]:

> Initially, I said I was leaning toward applying this because of popular
> acclaim.  It would have been more accurate to say that I wanted to avoid a lot
> of angry email.  I don't want to make decisions based on fear, because then
> whoever screams loudest wins.
>
> I don't think dots.pm would be good for perl, and am not going to ship it in
> 5.20.

Stevan Little spoke for many when he tweeted:

**NWCLARK TPF grant April report**

Nicholas Clark filed his TPF grant report for April; a great read to keep up with
the vital things the grant pays for.

**I made t/podcheck.t less sensitive and fixed various pod issues**

There's been a long-running mostly civil exchange about a commit
made a few weeks ago about a pod check test. RJBS stepped in and [wrote
in part][4]:

> I feel like this situation is flying (with excruciating slowness) off the
> handle.

> [P]ushing a change like this, when there is probably going to be some
> disseent, especially from those who have already done
> work on the code, is going to have a cost in morale.

> I believe the solution to "too much petty bickering" is "better
> discussions," not preemptive commits.  The latter leads to bad feelings and
> edit wars, not a culture of teamwork and peer review.

**perl needs safer implicit close**

One of the things Ricardo Signes mentioned in his YAPC talk "Postcards from the Edge"
was that he wanted to see Perl gain a safer implicit close in 5.20.  This week
he posted a message to that effect on the P5P list.

**An observation: Short- vs. long-term benefits**

Steffen Mueller posted a short note about some of the criticism on the 
"." vs "->" patch because some of the reactions were that a change like
this has no short term benefit to the language.

**[PATCH] Add an API to attach a signature string to a CV**

Peter Martini asked the P5P list to review his patch to the magic API.

**Perl experiments**

RJBS has been posting all of the experiments. Here's a collection of the
messages:

* [experimental: backtracking control verbs][9]
* [experimental: (?{...}) and (??{...})][10]
* [experimental: lvalue subroutines][11]
* [experimental: the :pop and :win32 pseudolayers][12]
* [experimental: "our $attribute :unique"][13]
* [experimental: "long doubles still don't work on solaris" ???][14]

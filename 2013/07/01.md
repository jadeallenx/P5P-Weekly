Perl 5 Porters Weekly: July 1-7, 2013
=====================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.

Topics this week include:

* Use of bare << to mean <<"" is deprecated
* Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammars
* key/value hash slices summary
* postfix dereference syntax
* Things that have been deprecated for a long time
* Talk about deprecation...

**Use of bare << to mean <<"" is deprecated**

So it's deprecated and to be removed in 5.20. This seems to have spawned a 
bunch of other threads about behaviors that have lingered on despite being
quote deprecated unquote.

**Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammars**

One of things in 5.18 that broke Regexp::Grammars has been reverted. Dave
Mitchell also suggested a potential path forward and sent it to Damian 
Conway for consideration, but there hasn't been a reply on P5P.

**key/value hash slices summary**

Ruslan Zakirov posted a collected summary on his hash slice syntax proposals.

**postfix dereference syntax**

This was a popular thread this week. Reactions to RJBS' email last week
rolled in. I was particularly taken with this syntax proposal by 
[David Golden][5]:

    $array->[]; # dereference
    $array->[$i]; # single element
    $array->[@list]; # array slice

    $hash->{}; # dereference
    $hash->{$n}; # single element
    $hash->{@list}; # hash slice

But some others threw what may be a spanner in that proposal. There
was a catch-all reply by RJBS [here][6] and there's even a patch
by sprout awaiting testing.

**Things that have been deprecated for a long time**

Ed Avis collected a list of things that have been marked as "deprecated" 
but are still in the language.

Here's his list:

    my $x if 0;                 # since 5.9.1
    defined(@x) and defined(%h) # since 5.6.1 or earlier
    sub foo {} do foo(1,2)      # since 5.10 or earlier
    chdir('')                   # since 5.10 or earlier
    %h->{a} and @a->[5]         # since 5.7.2; code committed 2001-05-08
    ?PATTERN?                   # since 5.10 or earlier
    $[ = 5;                     # since 5.10 or earlier
    dump                        # since 5.8
    Unrecognized escape \8      # since 5.8
    sub foo (@bar) {}           # since 5.8
    ::DESTROY                   # code committed 2002-03-16
    use UNIVERSAL;              # since 5.004_02

**Talk about deprecation...**

To put the cap on the talk of deprecation this week, Yves Orton
mentioned a serious wart in Perl since the days of Perl 4 from
the comments in op.c

               /* perl4's way of mixing documentation and code
                    (before the invention of POD) was based on a
                    trick to mix nroff and perl code. The trick was
                    built upon these three nroff macros being used in
                    void context. The pink camel has the details in
                    the script wrapman near page 319. */
                    const char * const maybe_macro = SvPVX_const(sv);
                    if (strnEQ(maybe_macro, "di", 2) ||
                        strnEQ(maybe_macro, "ds", 2) ||
                        strnEQ(maybe_macro, "ig", 2))
                            useless = NULL;
                    else {

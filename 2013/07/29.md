**Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammars**

Working on the various issues reported by Damian Conway in Regexp::Grammars
and perl 5.18, Dave Mitchell found a serious regression in the 5.18 regex
engine where a comment ('#') in a character class stops code blocks from being
parsed.

This has been backported to 5.18.1

**Empty regular expression does not match in some cases**

Petr Pisar reported what seemed like a bug, but it turns out it's
a feature.

H. Merijn Brand replied with a quote from perlreref:

> If 'pattern' is an empty string, the last successfully matched regex is
> used. Delimiters other than '/' may be used for both this operator and the
> following ones. The leading "m" can be omitted if the delimiter is '/'.

**Using braces on 'if'**

Nothing like some C style bikeshedding.

**refactoring regex execution / calling**

Dave Mitchell commited a huge new patch with tons of refactoring and fixes
in Perl's regex engine.

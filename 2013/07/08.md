Perl 5 Porters Weekly: July 8-14, 2013
======================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.

Topics this week include:

* experimental? internal functions with M flag
* experimental? Sun Studio Compilers for Linux OS
* perlopentut branch for review

**experimental? internal functions with M flag**

RJBS writes that he's removing this section from perlexperiment that
talks about functions with an `M` flag. This flag denotes that the 
function is "experimental" and may change or be removed without 
further notice.

**experimental? Sun Studio Compilers for Linux OS**

Using Sun Studio Compiler for the Linux OS is marked as experimental.
RJBS notes it's more accurate to say that

> "We'd like it to work, nobody seems to be smoking it, we  don't 
> know whether it works."  We treat it like any other platform.

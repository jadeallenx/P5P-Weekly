Perl 5 Porters Weekly: July 15-21, 2013
======================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list. I'm at OSCON this week, so if you're in town,
please come to one (or both) of my talks.  One is about [replacements for
LWP::UserAgent][1] and the other is about [DTrace in Perl, Python and Erlang][2].

Topics this week include:

* Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammar
* RFC: $/="\R"; perl -0R
* POSIX::foo() ignore UTF8ness
* postfix dereference syntax

**Perl 5.18 and Regexp::Grammar**

Damian Conway was able to reply to Dave Mitchell's email of a couple weeks ago.
In it, Damian provides 3 test cases for common usage of the module which are
broken.

**RFC: $/="\R"; perl -0R**

Karl Williamson writes that Perl violates a Unicode requirement, so he proposes
extending $/ to permit a special value which indicates it should use the official
Unicode record separators.

**POSIX::foo() ignore UTF8ness**

Karl Williamson points out that functions in the [POSIX][5] module treat input
as bytes and not characters.  He asks, "What should we do?"

**postfix dereference syntax**

Ricardo Signes shows off a diff of Dist::Zilla using the proposed postfix
dereference syntax.

Perl 5 Porters Weekly: October 7-October 13, 2012
=================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list. Sorry this week's summary was delayed, I just ran
out of tuits this past weekend. Let's get right to the topics this week:

* Perl 5.14.3 is now available
* maint-5.12, maint-5.14, and CVE-2012-5195
* perl 5.16.2 cometh
* Stupid COW benchmarks
* aasign'ing hash with odd number of elements and duplicates
* Compile option to disable taint mode: speedup
* Making PerlIOStdio\_invalidate\_fileno() less invasive on FreeBSD

**Perl 5.14.3 is now available**

Dominic Hargreaves announced that perl 5.14.3 is now available on a CPAN
mirror near you.

**maint-5.12, maint-5.14, and CVE-2012-5195**

Ricardo Signes announced that he'd pushed a CVE fix to the maintenance
branches of perl-5.14.3 and perl-5.12.5.

**perl 5.16.2 cometh**

In another announcement, Ricardo posted that he'd applied the fixes he knew
needed backporting to maint that didn't make it into 5.16.1. He encouraged
people to speak up about other patches which should be considered for
inclusion into 5.16.2 in early November.

**Stupid COW benchmarks**

Father Chrysostomos announced that he'd finished some work on a
Copy-on-Write perl.

    To do COW with a refcount stored in the string buffer, we have to check
    that SvLEN is at least two bytes greater than SvCUR and than the
    reference count has not reached 255.  That overhead slows down COW.

He shows that for short strings (i.e., "hello") assigned a million times, 
no-COW overhead is a winner by a second. But for long strings ("hello" x
1000) assigned a million times, COW is a winner by almost 3.5 seconds.

**aasign'ing hash with odd number of elements and duplicates**

Ruslan Zakirov wrote that he's uncovered some odd behavior when Perl is
given a list with an odd number of elements and some duplicates.

    If a hash is assigned with odd number of elements then we get a
    warning, but code continues and return values should be maintained.
    Simple case:

    $ perl -E 'say scalar %h = (1..3)'
    1:2:3
    $ perl -E 'say scalar(%h = (1..3))'
    3

    Quite resonable results from the first glance and reproducible since
    5.8.9 to blead.

    Things get messy with duplicates:

    $ perl -e 'print join ":", (%h = (1,2,3,4,1)), "\n"'
    1:2:3:4:1:

    Older versions produce different result, but it's not important.

    If we say that the case without duplicates produces correct and
    expected results then result in the last situation should be "3:4:1".
    It's important to note that order matters here, it can not be "1:3:4".
    
He offers some potential solutions and there is a good bit of back and forth
about whether this behavior is expected or an error.

**Compile option to disable taint mode: speedup**

Steffen Mueller made an experimental patch to completely disable the
tainting mechanisms in Perl as a compile option to provide a bit more speed
than usual. (He estimates this makes Perl 10-20% faster than normal.)

    I would NOT want this to be the default behaviour, but having this an 
    option could be a boon to people like my employer, who run Perl on 
    thousands of machines and capacity is as important as latency. (Thus the 
    eternal "you spend more time waiting for IO" doesn't apply.)

    I would love some review of the changes to the effect of what you think 
    needs doing in order to get this into blead. Just to reiterate: This 
    would be an opt-in perl.o-compile-time option to disable taint support 
    in the perl binary.

He's looking for some additional feedback on this option.

**Making PerlIOStdio\_invalidate\_fileno() less invasive on FreeBSD**

I'm afraid this note to p5p has been warnocked.  John Baldwin wrote that
he's working on the stdio bits in FreeBSD's libc implementation and wants to
insulate a call in Perl's IO layer to a member of a struct he wants to make
private. He's looking for some direction on how this ought to be
accomplished.

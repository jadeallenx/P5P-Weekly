mirror near you. He writes:

    This release is primarily a security fix release, according to the
    maintenance policy for Perl 5. Three security fixes are included:

    - Encode decode_xs n-byte heap-overflow (CVE-2011-2939)
    - File::Glob::bsd_glob() memory error with GLOB_ALTDIRFUNC (CVE-2011-2728)

**no easy link to quick hacking recipe?**

Dave Mitchell proposed adding a section in perl's README about submitting
quick patches to Perl's source code, since there doesn't seem to be a direct
link to it, although it turns out there's a section entitled "SUPER QUICK
PATCH GUIDE" in [perlhack][4].

**-DNO\_TAINT\_SUPPORT in blead**

Steffen Mueller announced he'd pushed his no-taint patch to blead, although
there is currently no direct support for it in the Configure script.

Perl 5 Porters Weekly: August 27-September 2, 2012
==================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic on the perl5-porters email list.
The smartmatch discussion continues to be very popular, so its summary will go at the end
of this post. There was also a very long, very tedious thread about how Perl ought to handle 
UTF-8 output which almost demonstrated [Godwin's Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Godwin's_law) 
(the longer a thread continues, the higher the liklihood someone will call someone else a Nazi.)

If you're reading this on my [blog](http://byte-me.org) or somewhere else on the web, you
can now find the summaries in Markdown format in 
[this github repository](https://github.com/mrallen1/P5P-Weekly).

Also, since there seems to be influx of new readers, ohai! I started writing these summaries
after YAPC::NA 2012 after having a breakfast conversation with Gabor Szabo. If you don't already
read his [Perl Weekly](http://www.perlweekly.com) email newsletter, you really ought to sign 
up for it.

Topics this week include:

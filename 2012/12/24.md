Perl 5 Porters Weekly: December 24-December 31, 2012
====================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list.  Usually I go Monday to Sunday, but just to keep
things tidy, we'll make this the final summary of 2012 by including the 31st.

Topics for this week include:

* cPanel version of "Storable 2.39\_01" breaks backwards compatibility
* Please separate fixes to spelling from changes to code layout in patches
* Term::ANSIColor 4.01 released

**cPanel version of "Storable 2.39_01" breaks backwards compatibility**

Alex Vandiver posted a message that cPanel has shipped a version of Storable
identified as 2.39\_01 which appears to break the vendor-installed perl 
environment on cPanel installations. 

This has the effect of making other co-located Perl applications (RT for
example) break.  A back-and-forth about this issue revealed that cPanel is
preparing a fix for this problem to be released in January 2013 - it looks
like they are moving to [Sereal][1] or [Data::Messagepack][2].

**Separate fixes to spelling from changes to code layout in patches**

Earlier in this week, a patch was committed with included some whitespace
changes.  In a followup, Ricardo Signes, the perl project manager asked
people submitting patches to

    please separate fixes to spelling and grammar errors from changes to
    code layout.

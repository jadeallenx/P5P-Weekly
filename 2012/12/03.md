Perl 5 Porters Weekly: December 3-December 9, 2012
===================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic of the
perl5-porters email list. 

Topics this week include:

* security notice: Storable
* security notice: Locale::Maketext
* Does Unicode mandate a collation order?
* a job for someone? SvREFCNT\_dec\_NN()
* CERT Perl Secure Coding Standard

**security notice: Storable**

Ricardo Signes published a security notice about the Storable module that
ships in Perl's core.  He writes:

    A number of times over the years, there's been discussion about Storable
    as a vector for attack.  If a user can feed you Storable data that you
    didn't expect, he has a good chance of doing nasty things to your
    program.  This has been discussed on p5p and at YAPCs, but sadly never
    made it into the documentation.

    This has been fixed[.]

Thanks to Brian Carlson of cPanel who brought it to the P5P security team's
attention.

**security notice: Locale::Maketext**

Rik also issued another notice courtesy of Brian Carlson about the
`Locale::Maketext` module which also ships in Perl's core.  Ricardo
summarizes the problems as:

    * in a [method,x,y,z] template, the method could be a fully-qualified
      name
    * template expansion did not properly quote metacharacters, allowing
      code injection through a malicious template

**Does Unicode mandate a collation order?**

There was a question (not strictly Perl related) about whether Unicode
mandates a collation order.  It does, and the precise answer, according to
Tom Christensen is determined by what `DUCET` value is used internally by
the Unicode routines.

If you want the full explanation, [read Tom's reply][3]

**a job for someone? SvREFCNT\_dec\_NN()**

Dave Mitchell writes that he's just added the `SvREFCOUNT_dec_NN()` macro
which can be used in situations where the SV cannot be null.  In such cases,
the macro saves some code space, a test and a jump in the code path.  There
are 500 uses of the original `SvREFCOUNT_dec` in perl.  

If you ever wanted to dive into Perl's core and were looking for a fairly
easy task to get you going, this might be what you're looking for.

**CERT Perl Secure Coding Standard**

Yves Orton wonders if anyone's seen [CERT's Perl Secure Coding Standard][6].
Jeffrey Thalhammer writes back that he's hopeful a Perl::Critic module will
ship early next year incorporating the standard's guidelines.

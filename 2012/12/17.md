Perl 5 Porters Weekly: December 17-December 23, 2012
====================================================

Happy New Year! Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email
traffic of the perl5-porters email list. 

Topics this week include:

* perl 5.17.7 is now available
* Solaris smoke testers wanted
* Parrot 4.11.0 "All together - Happy Birthday Lovebird" Released!
* successful s///e clobbers $! on MSWin32
* JROBINSON grant report, #13
* POSIX wrapper for strptime()
* Is this a known unicode bug in 5.16.2?

**perl 5.17.7 is now available**

Dave Rolsky announced that perl-5.17.7 is now available from a CPAN mirror near you.

**Solaris smoke testers wanted**

Dave Rolsky also encouraged people who use Perl on Solaris to join the CPAN
testing/smoking group.

**Parrot 4.11.0 "All together - Happy Birthday Lovebird" Released!**

Reini Urban announced that Parrot 4.11.0 is now available for download.

**successful s///e clobbers $! on MSWin32**

Which makes bugs on Win32 harder to track down when using Carp because
Carp::format\_args() does such a substitution.

**JROBINSON grant report, #13**

Checking in on Jess Robinson's Perl to Android cross compiling effort, it
looks like there's an interesting side project which allows a Java process
to schlep fatpacked perl modules to an Android platform.

Full details are in the grant report. A demo is available on a [blog
post][8].

**POSIX wrapper for strptime()**

LeoNerd proposed making POSIX/strptime unbroken cross-platform, but there
was quite a bit of pushback on the idea.  The primary objection was that
the purpose of the POSIX module is to expose OS-specific functionality, and
the second objection was that a cross-platform strptime already exists in
Time::Piece.

**Is this a known unicode bug in 5.16.2?**

Anders Melchiorsen reported a strange bug in Perl's regex engine when it
somehow thinks it's processing UTF-8 (even though it isn't.) A series of
messages tracing the bug and trying to understand its origin followed. In a
followup Dave Mitchell supplied a fix for the problem.

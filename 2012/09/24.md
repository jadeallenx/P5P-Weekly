Perl 5 Porters Weekly: September 24-September 30, 2012
======================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic on the 
perl5-porters email list.  In case you missed hearing about it, don't forget
to sign up for Gabor Szabo's [Perl Maven programming contest][1].

This week's dusty thread is from the week of July 30, 2012. Pumpking Ricardo 
Signes was looking for volunteer(s) to do some hacking on a gitalist
installation hosted on perl5.git.perl.org.  [Read about the details here.][2]
Are you interested? [Contact Rik][3].

Topics this week include:

* Perl 5.14.3 RC1
* JROBINSON grant report #10, #11
* [PATCH] Suggest cause of error requiring .pm file
* Auto-chomp
* Refactoring t/op/lex\_assign.t to use test.pl
* Why is Filter::Simple in core distribution?
* Features and keywords versus namespaces and functions
* Taking CPANPLUS out of core

**Perl 5.14.3 RC1**

Dominic Hargreaves announced that the first release candidate of Perl 5.14.3
has been posted to a CPAN mirror near you.

**JROBINSON grant report #10, #11**

Jess Robinson has been working on a grant project to get Perl crosscompiling
on the Android platform. She reported that she was able to get perl-5.17.4
into an Android package file (.apk) Hopefully she will be ready to start
running the Perl test harness in future work.

**[PATCH] Suggest cause of error requiring .pm file**

Paul Johnson submitted a patch to implement the [discussed changes][7] to the
error Perl emits when a module can't be loaded.  The current message reads:

    Can't locate Stuff/Of/Dreams.pm in @INC (@INC contains: ...)

With Paul's patch, the message now reads:

    Can't locate Stuff/Of/Dreams.pm in @INC (did you install the
    Stuff::Of::Dreams module?) (@INC contains: ...)

He tested this patch by installing Task::Kensho, Catalyst, Dancer and some
other modules without problems.

**Auto-chomp**

David Golden mused that he'd likely want a PerlIO layer that auto-chomped
newlines from input. Leon Timmermans wrote:

    Given the current PerlIO, that is effectively impossible. It would be
    a useful datapoint for a readline rewrite though.

There was some further discussion about given/when and smartmatch utility
(or lack thereof.) Using [a new thread][9], David Golden wrote:

    Overall, I find it sort of ugly that we have three things that are all
    effectively the same:

        foreach ( $foo ) { ... }
        given ( $foo ) { ... }
        for ( $foo ) { ... }

    The remaining benefit of given() is that it doesn't have any loop
    setup overhead and it has a return value (though it needs to be
    wrapped in do {...}):

        my $value = do { given ( $foo ) { ... } };

    Is that really worth having another keyword?  Could for/foreach return
    a value similarly (without overhead in void context)?  Could
    for(SCALAR) be optimized to avoid the loop setup?  If we could do away
    with given(), I'd prefer to see it removed.

    when() feels more generally useful and I'm starting to question if we
    need to keep given().  And I'm neutral to negative about smartmatch
    now, so when() as an "if with implicit next" is the remaining thing
    that interests me.

**Refactoring t/op/lex\_assign.t to use test.pl**

As I noted back on [June 17][11], Colin Kuskie has been refactoring various
pieces of the Perl test harness over the past several months.  He wrote:

    I'm about done with the original list of files targeted for migration to 
    test.pl.  It's probably time to review that list, and do a second sweep to 
    cover any newly added tests.

And Ricardo Signes added:

    Thanks very much for this work, which is neither glamorous nor (I imagine) a
    boatload of fun.  It *is* appreciated!

**Why is Filter::Simple in core distribution?**

James Keenan asked why Filter::Simple is still in Perl's core distribution.
The general consensus seems to be that it should be moved to CPAN-only
status.

**Features and keywords versus namespaces and functions**

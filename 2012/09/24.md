Perl 5 Porters Weekly: September 24-September 30, 2012
======================================================

Welcome to Perl 5 Porters Weekly, a summary of the email traffic on the 
perl5-porters email list.  In case you missed hearing about it, don't forget
to sign up for Gabor Szabo's [Perl Maven programming contest][1].

This week's dusty thread is from the week of July 30, 2012. Pumpking Ricardo 
Signes was looking for volunteer(s) to do some hacking on a gitalist
installation hosted on perl5.git.perl.org.  [Read about the details here.][2]
Are you interested? [Contact Rik][3].

Topics this week include:

* Perl 5.14.3 RC1
* JROBINSON grant report #10, #11
* [PATCH] Suggest cause of error requiring .pm file
* Auto-chomp
* Refactoring t/op/lex\_assign.t to use test.pl
* Why is Filter::Simple in core distribution?
* Features and keywords versus namespaces and functions
* Taking CPANPLUS out of core

**Perl 5.14.3 RC1**

Dominic Hargreaves announced that the first release candidate of Perl 5.14.3
has been posted to a CPAN mirror near you.

**JROBINSON grant report #10, #11**

Jess Robinson has been working on a grant project to get Perl crosscompiling
on the Android platform. She reported that she was able to get perl-5.17.4
into an Android package file (.apk) Hopefully she will be ready to start
running the Perl test harness in future work.

**[PATCH] Suggest cause of error requiring .pm file**

Paul Johnson submitted a patch to implement the [discussed changes][7] to the
error Perl emits when a module can't be loaded.  The current message reads:

    Can't locate Stuff/Of/Dreams.pm in @INC (@INC contains: ...)

With Paul's patch, the message now reads:

    Can't locate Stuff/Of/Dreams.pm in @INC (did you install the
    Stuff::Of::Dreams module?) (@INC contains: ...)

He tested this patch by installing Task::Kensho, Catalyst, Dancer and some
other modules without problems.

**Auto-chomp**

David Golden mused that he'd likely want a PerlIO layer that auto-chomped
newlines from input. Leon Timmermans wrote:

    Given the current PerlIO, that is effectively impossible. It would be
    a useful datapoint for a readline rewrite though.

There was some further discussion about given/when and smartmatch utility
(or lack thereof.) Using [a new thread][9], David Golden wrote:

    Overall, I find it sort of ugly that we have three things that are all
    effectively the same:

        foreach ( $foo ) { ... }
        given ( $foo ) { ... }
        for ( $foo ) { ... }

    The remaining benefit of given() is that it doesn't have any loop
    setup overhead and it has a return value (though it needs to be
    wrapped in do {...}):

        my $value = do { given ( $foo ) { ... } };

    Is that really worth having another keyword?  Could for/foreach return
    a value similarly (without overhead in void context)?  Could
    for(SCALAR) be optimized to avoid the loop setup?  If we could do away
    with given(), I'd prefer to see it removed.

    when() feels more generally useful and I'm starting to question if we
    need to keep given().  And I'm neutral to negative about smartmatch
    now, so when() as an "if with implicit next" is the remaining thing
    that interests me.

**Refactoring t/op/lex\_assign.t to use test.pl**

As I noted back on [June 17][11], Colin Kuskie has been refactoring various
pieces of the Perl test harness over the past several months.  He wrote:

    I'm about done with the original list of files targeted for migration to 
    test.pl.  It's probably time to review that list, and do a second sweep to 
    cover any newly added tests.

And Ricardo Signes added:

    Thanks very much for this work, which is neither glamorous nor (I imagine) a
    boatload of fun.  It *is* appreciated!

**Why is Filter::Simple in core distribution?**

James Keenan asked why Filter::Simple is still in Perl's core distribution.
The general consensus seems to be that it should be moved to CPAN-only
status.

**Features and keywords versus namespaces and functions**

Yves Orton started an interesting thread about adding new functionality via
keywords or via functions in a special purpose namespace (i.e.,
_scalar::weaken_) because Yves has [some contributions][14] he'd like to 
put into a specialized namespace, rather than as some kind of new language
keyword.

    [A]s I understand the feature/keyword approach is required when
    the change involves modifying how Perl code is parsed. For example
    adding a new infix operator has the potential of breaking code that
    uses the same token as a function name or worse cause it to be
    interpreted in entirely new ways without breaking.

    Namespaces on the other hand exist to work around the problem of
    function name collisions. They are the standard way to add library
    code to an application in Perl and virtually all other modern
    languages.
    
    [...]

    [W]e currently *do* have a number of built in routines in specialized
    namespaces, and indeed some of those were not even put in reserved
    namespaces, so they could quite easily have broken code when they were
    added yet if they did it was seen as a minor issue. This is not a new
    precedent.

    [...]

    So to repeat for clarity: Under what circumstances should the Perl
    language be extended via new keywords and features and under what
    circumstances should it be extended via functions and namespaces?
    
David Golden replied:

    I think you left out an important distinction:  "Which are available by
    default and how?"

    My hypothesis is that the desire for "features" is linked to the
    desire for sticking it in "features.pm" which means that "use v5.NN"
    gives a better set of defaults.

    [...]

    I don't want to then add a whole bunch more imports for things that I
    think should be available by default.
    
Jesse Luehrs added:

    I think this is slightly missing the point. The question is, do we want
    functions added to the language to be more like 'say', or more like
    'utf8::encode'? utf8::encode is available by default (doesn't require a
    use statement), and doesn't require a feature because it's not in the
    main namespace.
    
Yves agreed that was his point exactly.  He also clarified that the Perl
'use 5.0xx' pragmata should import a sensible set of default features
regardless of their implementation.  He feels that using namespaces
addresses backwards compatibility in a much better way than a new keyword.

David Golden wrote that he disagreed the namespace approach addresses
backwards compatibility "better" than any other:

    I respect that you feel what I'm saying is FUD, but I hope you
    understand that I've personally suffered the pains of attempted
    back-emulation [in version.pm], so at least I speak from experience and
    we can agree to disagree over the probability that it will happen again.

    But let me step back a second.  We have *plenty* of dual-life modules
    and we live with the compatibility issues already.  I think the
    version.pm issue is that there are two code-bases.  One *compiled-in*
    in universal.c and the other a copy in the version.pm source (plus
    some PP/XS trickery).  That does have a maintenance burden as John
    Peacock and I and others working on it have seen.

    [...]

    I think these debates are much more about what should be available by
    default and not so much about the implementations.

**Taking CPANPLUS out of core**

Sawyer X wrote that he wanted to tackle an item on Rik's perltodo document,
deprecating CPANPLUS and its module dependencies. He did a good bit of
research to find what CPANPLUS dependencies can be safely removed and came
up with this list:

* File::Fetch
* Term::UI
* Module::Pluggable
* Object::Accessor
* Log::Message
* Log::Message::Simple
* Module::Loaded
* Locale::Maketext::Simple
* Archive::Extract
* Params::Check
* Module::Load::Conditional
* IPC::Cmd
* CPANPLUS
* CPANPLUS::Dist::Build

The primary objections seemed to boil down to wanting to keep certain
dependencies in core anyway (such as File::Fetch and IPC::Cmd) and that
CPANPLUS seemed to be more reliable on certain platforms (e.g., VMS) than
the CPAN.pm client.
